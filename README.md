# Population_Site
Population site
## Project brief:
  A web application that retrieves country and population data
  from a REST API. You will need to consume the data and display this information on a
  frontend. The stakeholders want an easy way to visualise how many people live in each
  country.
## Key features
+ Displaying country data with population data
+ Simple to see
+ Easy to use
## Libraries and tools:
frontend: HTML, CSS and Javascript
backend: Flask
+ matplotlib - graph creation on the data visualisation page
+ Requests - handling rest api data
+ jinja2 - template tool build into flask, used to create website base
## Creation and Design process
The frontend was design using paper sketches which then informed the research for a backend and potential tools to use.
